The project aims to provide an easy solution for team mate finding and other problems that can occur throughout a hackathon. There is a wide range of features that was implemented but the team mate finder is definitely the most complicated. The algorithm ranks each user by his answers to AI generated questions, then another AI creates a "portfolio" of each member and matches them.
